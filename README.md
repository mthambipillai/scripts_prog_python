This repo contains series of python exercices as well as bash scripts to run unit tests on those.

Usually python unit testing with pytest focuses on testing functions in an object oriented way. But these python exercices are intended for beginners and don't contain any functions.

Consequently, bash scripts are easier to test simple python scripts. Moreover, the default option verifies python exercices of a same serie in order, such that students are forced to validate the first exercice before moving on to the next.
